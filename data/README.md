# Education Impact on Voting Behavior - Raw data

The raw data for this project is taken from the American National Election Studies [ANES](https://electionstudies.org). The [time series data](https://electionstudies.org/data-center/anes-time-series-cumulative-data-file/) is too large for github, thus should be downloaded separatedly, though uneccessary for the scripts used in this projects.

The relevant data subset used in this project is included in the `output/` directory.

## Description

This project takes a glimps into the education level difference between Democrat voters and Republican voters. 

Specifically, this report aims to understand what make up the majority of the voting bases, their preferences, and what they like and dislike about the parties they prefer. To potentially explain their voting choices, we also look at their feeling toward various issues such as education and immigration.

The project also looks closer into the voting trend in 2016. Through this exploratory analysis, we hypothesize that aggressive immigration agenda was a big factor of Trump's success 2016.
